# MARACA Showcase (Static Prototype)

This is a FREE, static, “final-looking” prototype:
- Sidebar categories (Kitchens / Bedrooms / Furniture)
- Kitchen configurator (2 wood types, colors, modules, appliances)
- Instant pricing
- Saved quotes (localStorage)

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1) Upload these files to your GitHub repo root
2) Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → Branch: main / (root)
3) Open your Pages link

Note: This static version has **NO backend** and **NO real AR**.
Next phase is Unity + AR Foundation + real 3D models + factory pricing rules.
